------------------------------------------
The end???

------------------------------------------
v3.2.0 to v4.0.0(*** ** 2020 - *** ** 2020)

Core:
add Dragonball OG/EZ/VZ CPU builtin LCD controller support too muExpDriver, some Palm OS 1<->3 games write directly to these registers to display their video and they won't work(with the exception of LSSA since the OS monitors that one)

------------------------------------------
v1.1.0 to v3.2.0(*** ** 2020 - *** ** 2020)

RetroArch GUI:
//TODO: allow adding more content after boot
//TODO: get EMU_MANAGE_HOST_CPU_PIPELINE working on other platforms then the main 4
//TODO: get OpenMP working with RetroArch(already works but breaks the no external libs rule)
//TODO: switch to high contrast and top left corner aligned mouse cursors
//FIXED: when compiling with "make platform=windows_x86_64" the dll wont load(theres a really good chance its because "libgomp-1.dll"(the OpenMP handler library) is missing from the RetroArch folder)(fixed by disableing OpenMP :( )

Qt GUI:
//TODO: get circleci builds for QT port on Win/Mac/Linux
//TODO: allow reiniting the emu without closing the program
//FAIL: render with OpenGL widget(should be a major speed boost)(switched to the method from firebird instead and it changed nothing)

Core:
//TODO: thumb mode supposedly dosent work with ARM dynarec, test this and fix mode switches if it does
add Palm Tungsten T3 support

------------------------------------------
v1.0.0 to v1.1.0(Feb 25 2019 - Easter 2019)

RetroArch GUI:
*allow mouse cursor to be rendered with multiple CPUs(removed for now)
*now launches content like cartridge based systems
*make default button layout match default controller layout better
*allow disabling the silkscreen area
*booting without game works again
*add multithreading and pipeline speedups(disabled for now because of compiling issues)

Qt GUI:
//TODO: allow using host serial ports in Palm OS
//TODO: saving states isn't working on Mac OS, it won't create the directory, don't know why(its not the . in the path either already tested), QDir returns false so it is failing?
*fixed state manager not loading until a state is saved
*boot button uses install button icon now, changed install button to icon a "+"
*put back left/right/center keys
*added install and boot buttons to both modes, content loaded with the boot button has separate save paths just like cartridge systems
*added instant boot option, no longer have to wait for the 5 second boot up if you dont want to(instant boot is always on for loading games)
*can now set the feature bits
*can now set the resource directory
*keyboard mapping support

Core:
*implement UART1/2 to fix crashing when beaming or hotsyncing
*PLLFSR timing hack is gone, CLK32 bit now just toggles properly mid CLK32
*SD card access routines are now 6<->7X faster
*add a launcher to load prc/pdb/pqa files
*add frameskip for really low power devices and when video is not needed
*added host CPU pipeline control for another speed up
*implement FEATURE_SYNCED_RTC to make the Palm clock always match the host system clock
