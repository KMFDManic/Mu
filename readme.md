# Palm OS emulator(Mu)

This is a complete restart of my Palm OS emulator, with the last one the code got too messy and the goal too ambitious(to emulate every palm API in software and for compatibility with all Palm OS versions and devices).


# The goal of this project

To emulate every part of the Palm m515 that is used by the OS perfectly.
This means no hacks like POSE where API calls are intercepted and replaced with those that dont use the actual hardware.
It is also written in C for RetroArch so it will run on everything at the start, not just Win95 like POSE and Copilot and is being developed with modern emulator features in mind, save/load state and overclocking are available from the start.

## Why the m515?

It is the best Palm brand OS 4 device that has no special hardware builtin(cellphone, barcode scanner, keyboard attachment), it has a color screen, and available ROM dumps.

## What about accessories?

The Palm keyboard attachment will likely be emulated later on so the PC keyboard can be used on text fields.

## What about OS 5?

I am planning on adding Tungsten T3 support as soon as possible.

## Building
#### For RetroArch
Make sure you have done all the steps here https://docs.libretro.com/ under "For Developers/Compilation" so you build environment works.  

    cd ./libretroBuildSystem
    make

#### For Qt
Install Qt 5.11.1 and Qt Creator(optional) if not installed  
Open the .pro file in Qt Creator and click "Run" or build from command line

##### To build without Qt Creator(untested)

    cd ./qtBuildSystem/Mu
    qmake
    make

#### TestSuite for Palm OS
Install prc-tools from the below link(self compiled or prepackaged VM)  

    cd ./tools/palm/hwTestSuite
    ./make.sh

#### MuExpDriver for Palm OS
Install prc-tools from the below link(self compiled or prepackaged VM)  

    cd ./tools/palm/muExpansionDriver
    ./make.sh

## Running
#### Files
palmos41-en-m515.rom(all euro languages, from Palm dev program): 412557a221933a8be12622de7a21320a (MD5)  
palmos41-en-m515.rom(English only, verified authentic from device): 83cb1d1c76e568b916dc2e7c0bf669f6 (MD5)  
palmos52-en-t3.rom: de46ec84d9aabf655eabdf9b00a3845d (MD5)   
bootloader-en-m515.rom(v1): 9da101cd2317830649a31f8fa46debec (MD5)  
bootloader-en-m515.rom(v2): e64c755205bc3e79d1bc5b70128f688d (MD5)  

If you can read English or intend to install your own language pack use the verified version:  
I understand not everyone speaks English so I list both ROMs, I do all my testing on the English only build because I have verified it with an actual device, but will do my best to support the Palm dev version as well(it runs on the same hardware anyway).

#### For Qt
 1. Run once to create the directory tree
 2. Copy "palmos41-en-m515.rom" and "palmos52-en-t3.rom" to "~/Mu"
 3. (Optional)Copy "bootloader-en-m515.rom" to "~/Mu"
 4. Run emu and press start button

 #### For RetroArch
 1. Download "Palm OS(Mu)" from "Online Updater->Core Updater"
 2. Go back, select "Load Core", select "Palm OS(Mu)"
 3. Copy "palmos41-en-m515.rom" and "palmos52-en-t3.rom" to the RetroArch system directory
 4. (Optional)Copy "bootloader-en-m515.rom" to the RetroArch system directory
 5. Run a .prc or .img file
