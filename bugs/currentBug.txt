QT release build is broken

Fixed:
Trys to turn the CPU off when it shouldnt(kernel was crashing, the MMU from firebird is not working)
68K Palm OS randomly locks up for 1-2 seconds(caused by interrupt handling code not turning the CPU back on for masked interrupts when it should because of faulty interrupt cacheing, Caused by commit: 1567cbce674741bc13be92b0847f59a5cc68335a)
