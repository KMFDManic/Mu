T3 locks up endlessly checking TSC2101 interrupts
Randomly locks up  for 1-2 seconds(this seems to have t do with the audio bug in applications where pushing the app category selector then white space will make a shorter or longer beep than it should, also lock ups occur in galax when sound plays)(Started somewhere between June 9 2019 and June 20 2019, right after all the UART stuff)
QT release build is broken
