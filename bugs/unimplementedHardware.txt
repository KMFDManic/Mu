CPU:
Test what bits of IMR are writable
hardware registers don't have there names printed in sandbox

CPU I/O:
Peripheral Control Register, audio ppm mixing selection
Setting the battery dead bit(PDDATA 0x80) if the emulated battery percent gets too low(don't know how low this is, a test will be slow and painful with how big the battery is on my device)
DRAMC write enable
Port M Infrared shutdown (PMDATA 0x20)
some undocumented I/O might be on port e and port j
SPITEST SSTATUS is undocumented and therefore unemulated
When SPICLK2, SPITXD or SPIRXD on port e is disabled ADS7846 functions should respond appropriately(not transmitting or receiving or blocking both for the clock)
REFREQ clock frequency in RTCCTL should slow down the RTC when enabled
Dont know if it possible to have the backlight on and the display off at the same time(theres no reason for it but it may be possible)
SPI1 slave mode, should never be used
RxOverflow on SPI1, don't know if back or front of FIFO is overwritten on overflow(currently losing oldest entry)
ICR POL(1,2,3,6) may flip the pin value as well as the interrupt, POL5 does not flip the INT5 pin though, this was confirmed with a hardware test(it doesnt seem to but there is instability on the pin when the SD card is plugged in, this may have to do with card detect also being a data line on the SD pinout)
PWM2 is not implemented
while it is stated that the PLL is turned off "30 clocks" after the DISPLL bit is set, it doesnt state where the clocks come from, CLK32 or SYSCLK
should also not transfer data to SD card when MOSI, MISO or SPICLK1 are disabled
port d data register INT* bits seem to have there data bits cleared when an edge triggered interrupt is cleared(according to MC68VZ328UM.pdf Page 10-15)
sound plays too long when the category's menu is selected on the home screen and the pen is pressed and held in the middle of the screen(only happens there, other views of the same type don't have this issue)(effected by CPU speed, turning it up reduces the duration of the excess squeal)(the home menu may be changing the clock speed when this menu is released since it refreshes a bunch of icons which is CPU intensive, if it is it would distort the audio since sysclks are only calculated at the begining of a frame the new value would not take effect until a new frame began, and since it works properly sometimes that is probably when the change occurs just at the end of the last frame and the sysclk duration refresh happens at the intended time due to the new frame starting)
UART1 OLD DATA interrupt uses timing, may just have this be the same a DATA READY
SPI1 rxOverflow is may not be emulated exactly as its supposed to be, the overflow data is written to the newest FIFO byte when it should probably be written to the oldest
UART CTS pin is not emulated
since actual UART hardware is not being used should be safe to ignore the parity bit and timing

Memory:
unknown if DRAM bit expanded address space is used for CSC when its not an extension of CSD
there is conflicting information on whether the DRAM bit effects CSC, needs a test made
may need to emulated CSC0/1 chip selects

SED1376:
swivelview register

ADS7846:
verify chip select(no test has been done yet, but everything points to port g bit 2)
electrical noise on lines(conversions probably should have +-20 added to values)(probably no need for this, it works so theres no need to use less precise values)
in the edge case that SPICLK2 is disabled while using ADS7846 and a 1 was the last bit shifted out 0s will still be shifted in
need to to verify behavior of differential mode bit

TSC2101:
values of AUX1 and AUX2 are unknown an need to be tested, emulation has issues with the USB port shortly after and it would make sense that since the T3 has the same connector as the m515 AUX1 is the device type resistor in the bottom connector

SD Card:
block specific write protect bits don't work
IRQ2 may actually be attached to the SD Card data out pin, triggering an interrupt when a 0 is received to process the return data
need to test if Port J Pin 3(SD card chip select) is attached to Port D Pin 5(SD Card Status(IRQ2))(pinouts.ru says chip select and card detect are the same line)
This thing: case SEND_STATUS://HACK, need to add real write protection, this command is also how the host reads the value of the little switch on the side

Debug tools:
ADS7846 channels can't be read in single reference mode in hwTestSuite
Mu sandbox dosent have memory and opcode hooks setup when in ARMv5 mode

MakePalmBitmap:

Other:
Qt port dosent support Windows touchscreen input
T3 I2C currently has no ACK bits(should work without them its just inaccurate)(I2C works fine though)
T3 emulation attempts to set GPIO1(reset button) as an output
GPIO lines from misc chips to CPU are not implemented
PXA260 idle mode is unimplemented
0x0E071F16 MCR	P15, #0, R1, C7, C2, #5 is unimplemented along with several other unknown CP15 opcodes
