HwrDelay wasn't finishing fast enough, I just made each read count as a clock cycle since no apps should use it.

It could be that bit just needs to toggle twice as fast since it is the current value of the CLK32 pin, which has an up and a down as 1 clock cycle but I was toggling it just once at the end of each clock cycle.
